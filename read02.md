# what is Git?
**Git** is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

## Main Features of Git :

Git mostly relies on **local** operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources. 

Every single **change** applied to any file or directory is **tracked** by Git. And, as the gatekeeper, Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.

Git is set up to greatly **minimize** the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally **lost data**. Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.

### States of file in Git :
* committed.
* modified.
* staged.

**CLI** is a command line Interface program that accepts text input to execute operating system functions.

Command	| Description                                              |
--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
ls	    | List the directory (folder) system.                      |
cd      | pathname	Change directory (folder) in the file system.  |
pwd     | print current work directory                             |
cd ..   |	Move one level up (one folder) in the file system.       |
mkdir	  | Creates a new directory (folder).                        |
clear   |	Clears the CLI window.                                   |

Below there are some command in **Git** :

git Command	| Description                                          |
--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
git ls  | to show the List of directory (folder) system.           |
git add .. | when I do some changes on my file I use it.           |
git commit -m " " |	to commit my changes.                          |
git push origin main| in order to have my changes on GitHub        |
git pull origin main| in order to have my changes from GitHub to repo|


Finally, don't forget _**ACP**_.

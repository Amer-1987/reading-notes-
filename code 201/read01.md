When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

1. When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). You type a domain name or web address into your browser to visit a site;
for example: google.com, bbc.co.uk, microsoft.com.  


2. Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books; they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name. An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods / full stops. Every device connected to the web has a unique IP address; it is like the phone number for that computer.  


3. The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested. A web server is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users.  


4. The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.  



# HTML Structure :

* HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.  


# Extra  Markup :
* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

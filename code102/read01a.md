## growth mindset
The growth mindset can open pathways to more **creativity** and **possibility**, and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement.
A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love  of learning.

## fixed mindset
In a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

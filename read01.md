# Markdown ?

   Today, **Miss Israa** explained what it is MARKDOWN . She asked us to read and summarize the material.
Actually today was very `<tiring>`, because the duties and the information were many and very exhausting.
But in the end we will do all the homework today because of what we learned earlier about _**grouth thinking**_

## So what is *MARKDOWN* ?
   Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images,
and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.
Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

### Text  :  
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

### List  :
*Sometimes you want numbered lists:*

1. One  
2. Two  
3. Three


*Sometimes you want bullet points:*

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!


### Images  :  
*Format:*

### Links  :  
*Format*  

http://github.com - automatic!  
[GitHub](http://github.com)   


### Inline code  :  
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

### Blockquotes :    

As  Miss Israa and Miss Nahla and Mr Zatar said:

> N0 pain,
> No gain.  

### Emoji  :  
To see a list of Emoji,  ![GitHub supports](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908)   

### Automatic linking for URLs  :  
 Any URL (like http://www.google.com/) will be automatically converted into a clickable link.   
 
 ### Username @mentions :  
 Typing an @ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment. This is called an “@mention”, 
 because you’re mentioning the individual. You can also @mention teams within an organization.
 "@102d35"
 
 ### Tables  :  
 You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:  
 
 the code    |  code101   | code101  | code201  | code301  | code401  | 
 ------------|------------| ---------|----------| ---------| ---------|
 the time    |   1 day    | 5-8 day  | 4 weeks  | 4weeks   | 10 weeks |
 


### Ok, That's all . I wish to get good mark and to feel that Your efforts have not been in vain .   


### Thanks __Miss Isra'a, Miss Nahla and Mr Zatar__. Thanks to all working team in the college.

# JavaScript
 `JavaScript`(JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative.

The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification, and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification.

Do not confuse `JavaScript` with the `Java` programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantic, and use.

Learn how to program in JavaScript with guides and tutorials.

## For complete beginners:  
Head over to our Learning Area JavaScript topic if you want to learn JavaScript but have no previous experience with JavaScript or programming.

###  *JavaScript first steps  :*
Answers some fundamental questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", and "what can it do?", along with discussing key JavaScript features such as variables, strings, numbers, and arrays.

###  *JavaScript building blocks :*  
Continues our coverage of JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code blocks such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events.

### *Introducing JavaScript objects:*
The object-oriented nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with your knowledge of the language and write more efficient code, therefore we've provided this module to help you.

### *Asynchronous JavaScript :*
Discusses asynchronous JavaScript, why it is important, and how it can be used to effectively handle potential blocking operations such as fetching resources from a server.

### *Client-side web APIs :*  
Explores what APIs are, and how to use some of the most common APIs you'll come across often in your development work.

## JavaScript Variables

There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:

* Using  `var`
* Using  `let`
* Using  `const`

This article uses `var` .
#

### Variables
Variables are containers for storing data (values).

In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:

 `Example`  
var x = 5;  
var y = 6;  
var z = x + y;  

* From the example above, you can expect:

x stores the value 5  
y stores the value 6  
z stores the value 11  
 

### The Assignment Operator

In JavaScript, the equal sign `(=)` is an **"assignment"** operator, not an "equal to" operator.  
The **"equal to"** operator is written like `==` in JavaScript.

### Declaring (Creating) JavaScript Variables  :
Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.

### One Statement, Many Variables  :
You can declare many variables in one statement.  

`Example`  
var person = "John Doe",  
carName = "Volvo",  
price = 200;  




### JavaScript Arithmetic  
As with algebra, you can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables, using operators like = and +:    

`Example`  
var x = "John" + " " + "Doe";   

The result of adding "John" + " " + "Doe":  
John Doe

`Example`  
var x = "5" + 2 + 3;   

The result of adding "5" + 2 + 3:  
523

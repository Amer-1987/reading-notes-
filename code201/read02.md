# Structural and semantic markup in HTML


HTML elements are used to describe the structure of  the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

  They also provide semantic information (e.g. where  emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

* **Structural markup**: the elements that you can use to 
describe both headings and paragraphs.  

* **Semantic markup**: which provides extra information; such 
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something 
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the 
meaning of acronyms, and so on.  

## Superscript & Subscript :
* **<sup>**
The <sup> element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power such as Num^2.  

* **<sub>**
The <sub> element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas such as H2SO4.

## Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules :  

* **<br />** As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line. But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag *<br />* .  

* **<hr />** To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the *<hr />* tag .

# Introducing CSS :  
*CSS* allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that  the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one  headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

Once you have learned how to write a CSS rule, learning CSS mostly involves learning the different properties you can use. 

So this topic will:  

● Introduce you to how CSS works.  
● Teach you how to write CSS rules  
● Show you how CSS rules apply to HTML pages  


## Highlight :
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
* Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page

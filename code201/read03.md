#  HTML List and Boxes

# Lists:

There are lots of occasions when we 
need to use lists. HTML provides us with 
three different types:  

● **Ordered lists** are lists where each item in the list is  numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for  a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.  

● **Unordered lists** are lists that begin with a bullet point  (rather than characters that indicate order).

● **Definition lists** are made up of a set of terms along with the  definitions for each of those terms.

  ## Highlights:
  There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition. 

* *Ordered lists* use numbers.
* *Unordered lists* use bullets.
* *Definition lists* are used to define terminology.
* Lists can be nested inside one another.  


# Boxes :

Border, Margin & Padding  :

1. Border
Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.  


2. Margin
Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.    


3. Padding
Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.  


If you specify a width for a box, then the borders, margin, and padding are added to its width and height.

## Highlights:

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box. 
* You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
* You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
* It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
* Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
* Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
* CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.
  


## USING IF ... ELSE STATEMENTS

  ***if ... else*** statement allows you to provide two sets of code:   

1. one set if the condition evaluates to true   

2. another set if the condition is false     
   

• There is no need to provide an el se option. (You can just use an if statement.)   

• With a series of if statements, they are all checked even if a match has been found (so it performs more slowly than switch). 
 
   

## SWITCH STATEMENTS  

A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.  

• You have a default option that is run if none of the cases match.  

• If a match is found, that code is run; then the break statement stops the rest of the switch statement running (providing better performance than multiple i f statements).


## Highlights:  

* Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.   

* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.  

* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.    

* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code.  
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.   

* switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).   

* Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy. 
* There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.

# HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions

# Tables
There are several types of information 
that need to be displayed in a grid or 
table. For example: sports results, stock 
reports, train timetables.  

A table represents information in a grid format. 
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV 
schedules, and sports results  


## Basic Table Structure :
`<table>`  

The <table> element is used 
to create a table. The contents 
of the table are written out row 
by row  

`<tr>`  

You indicate the start of each 
row using the opening <tr> tag. 
(The tr stands for table row.) 
It is followed by one or more 
<td> elements (one for each cell 
in that row). 
At the end of the row you use a 
closing </tr> tag.  



`<td>`  


Each cell of a table is 
represented using a <td>
element. (The td stands for 
table data.)
At the end of each cell you use a 
closing </td> tag.  

`<th>`  

The <th> element is used just 
like the <td> element but its 
purpose is to represent the 
heading for either a column or 
a row. (The th stands for table 
heading.)  

### Highlight :  

* The <table> element is used to add tables to a web 
page.  
* A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created 
with the <tr> element.  
* Inside each row there are a number of cells 
represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it is a 
header).  
* You can make cells of a table span more than one row 
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.  
* For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, 
<tbody>, and <tfoot>.  


# Functions, Methods, and Objects 

## Create an Object (Construction Notation):

To get a better idea of why you 
might want to create multiple 
objects on the same page, here 
is an example that shows room 
availability in two hotels. 
First, a constructor function 
defines a template for the hotels. 
Next, two different instances 
of this type of hotel object are 
created. The first represents 
a hotel called Quay and the 
second a hotel called Park.  

* Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.   
* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required 
to do their job) and may return a value.   
*  An object is a series of variables and functions that 
represent something from the world around you. 
* In an object, variables are known as properties of the 
object; functions are known as methods of the object. 
* Web browsers implement objects that represent both 
the browser window and the document loaded into the 
browser window. 
* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as 
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and 
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 
* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data 
sets (and both can contain the other).
